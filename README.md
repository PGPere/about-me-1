## Reflections and Comments
At this point, I feel confident with the basic structure of HTML, JS, and CSS. However, I still very much rely on previous work product, online resources, and lecture repo to cross-check my work and/or help me write the first draft of code. I hope to practice enough during the course of this class to the point where I can do many basic commands without looking things up to double check.
